# Chatbot

A conversational chatbot built in Python that can interact with users, interpret messages, and respond intelligently.

## Features

- Basic natural language understanding and response generation  
- Predefined intents / patterns + rule-based matching  
- (Optional) Ability to learn from past conversations  
- Easy to extend with new intents, responses, or modules  
- CLI or simple interface to chat with the bot  

## Architecture & Components

- **Input Processor**: Receives and normalizes user input (lowercase, remove punctuation, tokenization)  
- **Intent Matcher / Parser**: Matches input to known intents or patterns  
- **Response Generator**: Chooses the best reply based on matched intent or fallback  
- **Memory / Context (optional)**: Tracks conversation state or context  
- **Data Store (optional)**: For storing logs, training data, or conversation history  

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- (Optional) Additional libraries such as `nltk`, `spacy`, `transformers`, etc.  
- Dependency file (e.g. `requirements.txt`) listing required packages  

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cjricafrente/chatbot.git
   cd chatbot
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Optional) Download models, data files, or training corpora if used.

# Usage
Run the chatbot script to start a chat session:

bash
Copy code
python bot.py
You can then type messages and see how the bot responds. Use Ctrl+C (or equivalent) to stop.

# How to Extend / Customize
Add new intents: Create new patterns (e.g. keywords or regex) and attach response templates

Enhance parsing: Integrate NLP libraries (like spaCy) or embedding-based similarity matching

Use machine learning / transformer models: Replace rule-based matching with models

Context tracking: Keep track of prior messages to give more coherent multi-turn conversations

Logging & analytics: Save chat logs, compute usage metrics, or user feedback

# Example Conversation
vbnet
Copy code
User: Hi there  
Bot: Hello! How can I help you today?  
User: What’s the weather like today?  
Bot: I’m sorry, I don’t have weather data yet.  
User: Tell me a joke.  
Bot: Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!  
(Modify this to match exactly how your bot behaves.)
          
# How It Works
The user sends a message (text).

The input is cleaned and tokenized.

The matcher tries to find which intent (if any) the message belongs to.

The responder picks a reply from that intent’s response set (or fallback).

If context or memory is used, it helps refine later responses.

The bot outputs a reply and waits for the next user message.

# Future Improvements
Use machine learning / embeddings for better intent matching

Integrate external APIs (weather, news, jokes, etc.)

Add speech / voice interface

Create a web / GUI frontend (Flask, Streamlit, web chat)

Handle ambiguous / fallback responses more gracefully

Personalize responses per user (using user context)
